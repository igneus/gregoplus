# gregoplus

[Gregobase]()
([sources]())
is a unique resource of Gregorian chant scores
transcribed using
[Gregorio](),
but it's codebase is horrible and there is no active development.

Fortunately, the database is publicly available.
Thus *gregoplus* uses *gregobase*'s database to make it's contents
more accessible.

Contributions are warmly welcome.
